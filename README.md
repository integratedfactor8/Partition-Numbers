# Partition-Numbers
Python code to generate the partition numbers by adding and subtracting previous terms to find the next.
By default, the first 30 are printed. It can be edited to print more partition numbers by changing print(partiton_seq[:30]) to print(partiton_seq[n]) where n is the zero based index of the partition number you want. If it is out of range, change the variable end to be higher.
